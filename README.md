# ULTRASIP-Neutral-Points
Code for the use of the Ultraviolet Linear Stokes Imaging Polarimeter (ULTRASIP) for diurnal tracking of the polarization neutral points.
The code is organized into four main categories: 
1. Instrument Operation: code for operating ULTRASIP as a scanning polarimeter and each component independently - see OSF page for instrument description
2. Data Analysis: Processing code for observations, applies non-uniformity correction (NUC), calculates per-pixel metadata, calculates polarimetric data products, and guides the user for determining the neutral point observation and estimating the location. Additionally, the visualization code plots the results of the neutral point location estimations in various forms.
3. Theory: Any simulations to describe neutral point theory.
